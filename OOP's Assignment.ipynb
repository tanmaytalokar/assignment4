What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","\n","Ans -> `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects.\" Objects are instances of classes and can have both attributes (data) and methods (functions). OOP helps organize and structure code, making it easier to manage and reuse. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.`\n","\n","\n","##2. What is a class in OOP?\n","\n","Ans -> `A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class will have. Think of it as a recipe for making objects, where each object is an instance of the class.`\n","\n","\n","##3. What is an object in OOP?\n","\n","Ans -> `An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity in the real world with its own data and functionality. For example, if Car is a class, an object might be a specific car like \"Toyota Corolla.\"`\n","\n","\n","##4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n","Ans -> `Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features. For example, using a car without needing to know how the engine works.\n","Encapsulation is about wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components. This helps protect the object's state.`\n","\n","\n","\n","##5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `Dunder methods, or \"magic methods,\" are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (__). They allow you to define how objects behave with built-in functions and operations. For example, __init__ is a constructor method, and __str__ defines how the object is represented as a string.`\n","\n","##6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","\n","Ans -> `Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes. For example, a Car class can inherit from a Vehicle class.`\n","\n","##7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","Ans -> `Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, this means you can call the same method on objects of different classes, and each class can implement the method differently.`\n","\n","##8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using private variables and methods (prefix with _ or __). This hides the internal state and only exposes a controlled interface to interact with the object. It helps protect the data from being directly accessed or modified.`\n","\n","##9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `A constructor is a special method __init__ in Python that is called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes with initial values. It’s like a setup function for the object.`\n","\n","##10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `Class methods are methods that take the class itself as the first argument (cls). They can modify class-level attributes and are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n","Static methods don't take any reference to the class or instance as the first argument. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and are independent of the class and instance.`\n","\n","##11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `Method overloading allows defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python does not support true method overloading as in other languages; instead, you can achieve it using default arguments or variable-length arguments.`\n","\n","##12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","Ans -> `Method overriding happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class's method.`\n","\n","##13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property. This allows you to access the method like an attribute, making the code more intuitive and cleaner.`\n","\n","##14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","Ans -> `Polymorphism is important because it allows different classes to be treated in the same way, even though they might have different implementations. It simplifies code and allows you to write flexible and reusable programs.`\n","\n","##15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes contain abstract methods (methods that are declared but contain no implementation) which must be implemented by subclasses.`\n","\n","##16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","Ans ->\n","`Modularity: Code is organized into classes, making it easier to maintain and update.\n","Reusability: Classes can be reused across different programs.\n","Inheritance: Reuse code from other classes through inheritance.\n","Flexibility: Polymorphism allows different implementations to work with the same interface.`\n","\n","##17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","Ans -> `Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined inside the class but outside of any methods.\n","Instance variables are specific to each instance of the class. They are defined inside the __init__ method.`\n","\n","##18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `Multiple inheritance occurs when a class is derived from more than one base class. Python allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes, enabling it to inherit features from several classes.`\n","\n","##19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n","\n","Ans ->` __str__ is used to define a human-readable string representation of the object (for printing).\n","__repr__ is used to define a more detailed string representation, often used for debugging or when trying to create the object again from its string representation.`\n","\n","##20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `The super() function is used to call a method from the parent class. It helps in inheriting methods and properties from the superclass without explicitly referencing the parent class name.`\n","\n","##21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, before the object is removed from memory.`\n","\n","##22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `@staticmethod does not depend on class or instance. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class.\n","@classmethod takes the class itself as the first argument (cls) and can modify class-level attributes.`\n","\n","##23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","Ans -> `Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object calling them. Inheritance enables subclasses to override parent class methods, so different objects can invoke their own specific methods even if they share the same name.`\n","\n","##24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","Ans -> `Method chaining is the practice of calling multiple methods in a single statement. Each method returns the object itself, allowing for further method calls. For example: obj.method1().method2().method3().`\n","\n","##25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","\n","Ans -> `The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. It makes an object callable, enabling more flexible behavior for the object.`"],"metadata":{"id":"PeNmqIX3AnZ5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Practical Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"GOoUAKKW_5XU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
